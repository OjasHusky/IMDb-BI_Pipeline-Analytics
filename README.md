# IMDb-BI_Pipeline-Analytics

Built an end-to-end data warehouse and analytics solution using the IMDb dataset. Utilized Python's ydataprofile for data profiling and minor cleaning tasks to ensure high-quality inputs. Designed ETL pipelines with Azure Data Factory to load and transform data into Snowflake. Created dimensional models to support analytical queries and developed interactive dashboards in Power BI/Tableau to uncover insights on movie trends, ratings, and genres. The solution enhanced data visibility and enabled comprehensive analysis for decision-making.
