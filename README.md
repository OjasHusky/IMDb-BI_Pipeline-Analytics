## Project Overview
Our data team successfully completed an end-to-end data pipeline project using IMDB datasets. We were given 7 uncleaned datasets containing ratings, movie information, series details, and people involved in the industry. The goal was to process and visualize key insights in a single, intuitive Power BI dashboard.

## Steps We Followed 🛠️
1. **Data Cleaning:** Used Python for data wrangling and preprocessing.
2. **Data Staging:** Loaded the cleaned data into Snowflake using Azure Data Factory (ADF).
3. **Dimensional Modeling:** Designed a structured dimensional model to meet 15+ business requirements.
4. **ETL Pipeline:** Managed Stage-to-Dimension and Fact table loads using ADF.
5. **Visualization:** Built a Power BI dashboard covering all business insights in a simple, engaging format.

## Key Achievements 🎯
- Successfully handled multiple uncleaned datasets and transformed them into a structured warehouse.
- Optimized the data pipeline for efficiency and scalability.
- Created a user-friendly Power BI dashboard that effectively presents insights.
